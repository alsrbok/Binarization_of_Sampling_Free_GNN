# Binarization of Sampling Free GNN

I will upload the full code after I upload a thesis on arxiv.

Current code is about Strong Baseline for Binarized GNN.

(High Capacity Expert Binary Network, Binary to Real Network)

Baseline model "SAGN" is introduced by following paper: [Scalable and Adaptive Graph Neural Networks with Self-Label-Enhanced training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09376)
They modified "SIGN" Network by adding a residual term and attention mechanism.
Moreover, they suggested SLE training method.

Baseline code is https://github.com/skepsun/SAGN_with_SLE
